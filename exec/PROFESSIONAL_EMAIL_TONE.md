# Professional Consultant Email Tone

## Core Principles

When writing emails as a consultant, maintain these key principles:

### 1. Collaborative Partnership Language
- Use "we" and "us" instead of "you" when possible
- Frame as joint effort: "We need these inputs to proceed" vs "You need to provide"
- Emphasize partnership: "We appreciate your assistance" vs "You must complete"

### 2. Positive Solution-Oriented Framing
- Focus on what can be achieved vs what's blocked
- "Enable us to proceed" vs "blocking several development tracks"
- "Maintain momentum" vs "prevent delays"
- "Next phase of development" vs "critical dependencies"

### 3. Professional Urgency Without Pressure
- Acknowledge urgency without blame
- "At your earliest convenience" vs "immediately required"
- Explain impact positively: "To maintain our agreed timeline" vs "You're causing delays"

## Email Structure Template

```
**To:** [Client Team]
**From:** [Implementation Team]
**Date:** [Current Date]
**Subject:** [Action Required: Brief Description]

Dear Team,

I hope this email finds you well. [Brief context sentence about project progress]

**[Priority Section Header]** ([Original due date if overdue])

[Brief explanation of need, focusing on enabling progress rather than blocking issues]

• [Bullet point format for action items]
• [Include format/delivery method clearly]
• [Keep descriptions concise but clear]

[Positive framing sentence about how these inputs help the project succeed]

**[Future Items Section if applicable]**

**By [Date]:**
• [Future deliverable]

**Next Steps**

[Simple, clear instruction on how to respond - usually "Please email us your responses"]

[Closing that reinforces partnership and offers help]

Best regards,
[Team Name]
```

## Language Transformations

### ❌ Avoid → ✅ Use Instead

- "These are blocking development" → "These will enable us to proceed with the next phase"
- "Critical dependencies that must be provided" → "Inputs that will help us maintain momentum"
- "You need to submit" → "Please provide" or "We'd appreciate receiving"
- "This is overdue and causing delays" → "Originally due [date] - needed to maintain our timeline"
- "Submit to repository" → "Email us your responses" (if clients won't use repositories)

### Positive Reframing Examples

**Instead of:**
> "These deliverables are critical dependencies that are currently blocking several development tracks. Your prompt response will enable us to maintain the agreed implementation schedule."

**Use:**
> "These deliverables will enable us to proceed with the next phase of development and maintain momentum on the implementation. We appreciate your assistance in providing these inputs at your earliest convenience."

## Action Items Best Practices

### Format
- Use bullet points for scannability
- Include format requirements clearly: "(Excel/CSV format)", "(Yes/No with rationale)"
- Mention specific stakeholders when needed: "(requires Sean's approval)"
- Group by urgency/timeline

### Wording
- Start with action verbs: "Provide", "Complete", "Create", "Decide"
- Be specific about deliverables
- Include context in parentheses when helpful

## Closing Guidelines

### Next Steps Section
- Keep it simple and realistic
- Don't assume clients will use technical systems
- Offer help: "If you need clarification on any item..."
- Single clear instruction: "Please email us your responses"

### Sign-off
- Maintain partnership tone
- Express appreciation
- Keep it professional but warm
- End with team name, not individual

## Examples from SIMU Project

### Good Example (After Revision)
```
We appreciate your partnership in this implementation and look forward to receiving these inputs to keep the project moving forward successfully.

**Next Steps**
Please email us your responses for the above items. If you need clarification on any item or require assistance with the templates, please don't hesitate to reach out.
```

### What We Avoided (Original Draft)
```
These deliverables are critical dependencies that are currently blocking several development tracks.

**Next Steps**
Please submit completed items to the shared repository (`/client-deliverables/`) or via email response.
```
